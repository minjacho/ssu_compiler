# SSU COMPILER

This repo is for ssu compiler assignments

After the first write of minajae.y, yacc -d does not work with conflicts: 1 shift/reduce.

So, I tried to fix it but I can't and also y.tab.c and y.tab.h was maken so I just continue to type minjae.l.

Because minjae.l has different format in pptx file and text book, it's hard to understand.
